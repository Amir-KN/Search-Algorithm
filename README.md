# Search-Algorithm
We solve an interesting problem with the help of search algorithms.
You can see the diffrent algorithm that comment in code :
- `BFS`
- `IDS`
- `A*`
- `Weighted A*` <br />

For change *graph input*, you can change the name of file in input of open function :
```
input_file = open("./Inputs/in<#>.txt")
```
in code we use first input :
```
input_file = open("./Inputs/in1.txt")
```
You can add test case to `Search-Algorithm/Inputs/` directory.
